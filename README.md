# Django_Hospital_Management

## Project Description

Django_Hospital_Management is a web-based hospital management system built with Django.  
It provides basic functionality including booking appointments, showing hospital departments, and adding doctors.  
The project uses Djangoâ€™s default admin panel for backend management.  
**Note:** The CSS styling is not fully completed, but core features are functional.  
There are two main Django apps: `Hospital_Management` and `Home`.
